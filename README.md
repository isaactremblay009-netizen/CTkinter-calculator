# CTkinter-calculator
simple calculator with some cool features, top display, backspace button, minimalistic gui and extra functions. I had alot of help from chatgpt since i had zero clue how to use custom tkinter, but this project definitely helped me understand the CTKINTER syntaxes. Ive never used tkinter or ctkinter before.
